With the help of a mobile data entry system, it is possible to design much more efficient 
	logistics processes in a company since it is not necessary any more to perform all these tasks manually.
	Instead, you can simply scan items with an MDE scanner, which then sends the corresponding information directly
	to the merchandise management system. The advantage in this case is that the storage locations, batch numbers,
	and serial numbers do not have to be entered manually any more, which then prevents errors when entering the data.


the following functionality in the context of mobile data entry:
	* Placement of items in stock 
	* Stock transfers of items
	* Picking of items
	* Packaging of items
	* Reading items for the purpose of inventory


 A brief treatment of the barcodes used in the eEvolution standard is presented, as well as the practical application
	of mobile data entry in eEvolution. General Access to the MDE Suite is obtained through a terminal server
	on which eEvolution is installed. Mobile data entry is then performed with a mobile hand-held device
	that connects to the terminal server using the Remote Desktop Protocol and then obtains direct access
	there to the MDE Suite from eEvolution.


It is possible to save the login data as start parameters in a link on the desktop so you can log in to
	eEvolution automatically. This eliminates the need to log in manually to the database using the login
	screen since the login screen cannot be shown in full anyway on the small display of the MDE device.


In eEvolution, the start parameters for all modules basically consist of the following parameters:
	'c:\Programme\eEvolution' MDE-Suite.exe <DATENBANK> <MANDANTENNUMMER> <LOGIN> <PASSWORT>
	*  'c:\programs\eEvolution': Here you can enter the path to the *.exe on the terminal server. 
	* <DATABASE>: Here you can enter the name of the default database a user is automatically logged on to. 
	* <CLIENT ID>: Here you can enter the consecutive number of the client, under whose name the module is to be registered automatically.
	* <LOGIN>: Here you can enter the name of the user to be logged on automatically to the database. 
	* <PASSWORD> : Here you can enter the password allocated to the user.

special MDE-masks were developed. The following MDE-masks are available:
	* MDE storage
	* MDE Inventory
	* MDE picking
	* MDE re-booking
	* MDC during Packaging
	These masks have been optimized for display sizes of 320 x 240 pixels, they can, however, be used without any problem
	for individual display formats. For this, launch the eEvolution Customizer using the shortcut CTRL and F8 to adapt
	the dialog window to your individual needs.

Operation using the Windows Mobile operating system Specifically, Windows CE, Windows Mobile 5, Windows Mobile 6.1,
	and Windows Mobile 6.5 are supported as well as all operating systems that provide an RDP client and can send
	the string read in as keyboard input to the RDP application.

Ability to read a 2D barcode data matrix so that the standard barcode can be used.
	Technical Implementation: The MDE Suite uses the normal processes of eEvolution. It only uses a mobile data entry device
	in connection with the MDE screens optimized for them instead of a requiring you to enter the data manually. 
	In this case, eEvolution interprets the information read by the hand-held device and then displays it in a
	legible form on the screen using the MDE screens. 

Basically, a scanning operation can be described as follows:
	When scanning in a barcode, the MDE device simulates the keyboard input required to enter all the information encoded
	in the barcode. This input could be the item number, picking number, batch number, storage location number, or 
	serial number, for example. The MDE device can enter this data in a fraction of a second. After that, a command is sent
	informing eEvolution that the corresponding data was entered successfully. The command sent to eEvolution basically
	has the same meaning as when manually pressing the ENTER key after entering data manually. 

For mobile data entry in eEvolution, it is necessary to defined a standardized barcode for items, storage locations,
	pick lists, and packaging.A barcode is able to represent data using binary symbols that can then be easily processed by
	machines


 A barcode can be generated automatically in eEvolution, and the barcode itself is created List & Label. To accomplish
	this, you only need to edit the corresponding L&L report in the List & Label designer and insert the appropriate barcode
	supported by L&L and the MDE device at the desired position. 


The result is that the MDE modules need to be adapted to match the properties of a barcode when you do not want to use
	the standard eevolution barcode. Such adjustments are fairly common in customer projects, though.

	second one is this - http://www.wikierp.de/mde-suite.mde-suite_DasLagerplatzetikettBarcode.ashx

which  barcode is recommended/prefered?
In eEvolution, it is recommended to use the 2D data matrix barcode ECC 200, which provides a very powerful error
	correction algorithm. it provides large amounts of data for machine processing while requiring relatively little
	space. Another important point is support for different compression methods for text, numbers, or binary data.
	Even German umlauts can be represented without any problems.


standard definition of a character string in eEvolution?
The default definition supports the following prefixes:
	* ITEMNOS = Item label
	* STLOCLAB = Storage location label
	* PICKL = Pick list 
	* PICKLAB = Pick label


standard definition prefixes?
	* ITEMNO. = Item number
	* QTY = Quantity 
	* SNO = Serial number
	* BATNO = Batch number
	* WHNO = Warehouse number
	* CONSNO = Consecutive Number 
	Note:
	A storage location label thus indicates the 'Storage location number per item'
	* STLOC = Unique storage location
	* PICKNO = Picking number
	Each prefix is followed by a blank and the appropriate value. 
	Example:
	'ITEMNOS |ITEMNOR 123455|QTY 5|'


what is Storage Location Label Barcode?
The individual storage locations need a barcode so that an item can be read in, placed in stock, transferred,
	picked, or packed correctly. By assigning a barcode to each storage location, it is possible to assign items or 
	remove items scanned by the mobile data entry device to and from the bins. The storage location barcode is printed on
	the storage location label. The report 'lagerpl.lst' is used as the basis in this case. It can also be found in the
	QRP folder in the execution directory of eEvolution.


what information storage barcode contains?
The storage location label usually contains the name of the warehouse and the coordinates in the plain text,
	while all other information is contained in the barcode. The barcode includes the following information: 
	* String prefix - WHLAB 
	* Uniqe warehouse number - WHNO
	* Storage location number (per item) - CONSNO
	* Unique storage location - STLOC
	* Coordinate 1 - 5

is it possible to configure my own separator in the MDE settings?
The following string, on the basis of which the barcode will be generated, was developed based on this: 
	'WHET|WHNO Warehouse number|CONSNO Storage location number|STLOC Coordinate1 [*Coordinate2] [*Coordinate3] [*Coordinate4] [*Coordinate5] 


How to simulate a mobile data entry device?
By entering the folowing string -
	'WHET|WHNO Warehouse number|CONSNO Storage location number|STLOC Coordinate1 [*Coordinate2] [*Coordinate3] [*Coordinate4] [*Coordinate5] |'but you must use the exact same format as described above!



Tell me about Pick List Barcode?
The pick list needs its own barcode so that it is possible to associate commission numbers to pick lists without
	any problems. The barcode therefore contains the commission number, which can then be used to uniquely identify
	a pick list.


What information pick list barcode contains?
	* Picking No:
	* Order No.
	* All items to be picked including the item numbers, item names, and quantities 
	* W/H coord. 
	This information is necessary so that the person picking can determine the order of picking by themselves.


Q - What if items having labels without standard markings?
A - A guided picking process can be activated for items having labels without standard markings. 
	The corresponding report can be found under the name 'kompick10.lst' in the QRP folder.
Q - What is Pick Label?
A - A pick label is used if items are placed in stock without item labels. The pick labels contain the most important information on the commission.
	This is to ensure that it is still easy to associate items to the correct commission without any problems.

Q - What information pick label barcode has?
A - The barcode includes the following information
	* String prefix - PICKET
	* Item number - ITEMNO
	* Quantity - QTY
	* Serial number (for items controlled by serial numbers) - SNO
	* Batch (for batch-controlled items) - CHR
	* Picking No. - PICKNO 
Q - how to configure MDE in the Item Management Module?
A - Please find a short description below:
	* Autom.creation of labels when storing, allow labels to be printed automatically after the stock placement operation for items managed by serial number 
	or by batch or for items for which a packaging unit was stored. As soon as an item has been stored, the appropriate labels for the item are printed automatically.
Q - How to determine the number of item labels is being printed when placing item in stock?
A - 1. You mark this option in the Item module and enable 'Only print labels for marked items' in the Purchasing Management module under Basic Setting.
	2. You can specify the number of labels to be printed manually in the Stock Placement dialog as an alternative. 
	Only the number of labels entered here will be printed! 
Q - what if items that are not labeled by the suppliers?
A - This property only works for items in which the 'Automatic creation of labels' option has been enabled.
Q - what ia Packaging unit?
A - A packaging unit is used to combine a certain quantity of identical items to form a group. The quantity specified here is then used when printing
	the item labels so that you do not have to label items individually when the items are not managed by serial number or by batch.
	You can also specify the dimensions of the packaging unit here and enable and disable them separately for each item. 
Q - How to store several EAN numbers per packaging unit?
A - It is possible to store several EAN numbers per packaging unit since these numbers may differ for each packaging unit even when the packaging
	units are identical. These settings can be found on the Miscellaneous tab.
